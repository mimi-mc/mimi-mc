ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mimi-mc, currently a student @Wellcode

With 12 years of experience in a business development government organization, I have finally arrived at the important realization that my place is in the wonderful, ever-changing world of programming. Consequently, I have embarked on a journey of hard (but absolutely fascinating) work, and I am currently building my portfolio for my first job in programming! 

I look forward to starting my new life as a programmer!
